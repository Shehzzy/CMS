COVID TEST REGISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

There are three types of users in CMS.
1. Admin
2. Patient
3. Hospital

By clicking on the right side of the header , a simple user , neither hospital nor a patient can access the page regarding the type of user you are going to register as in the website.

If a user clicks on the patient, they will be directed to:

After getting registered, the user will be directed to their profile where they:
1. can update their profile or delete it.

If a user clicks on Hospital, they will be directed to:
